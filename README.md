TFE4171: Design of Digital Systems 2
==============================

Introduction
-----------------
### The verification gap
Traditional verification methodology (directed tests, etc.) cannot keep up with today's designs. Directed test does not scale to complex designs like system on chips (SoC). About 50% of a projects resources go to functional design verification. More than 50% of designs require re-spin due to functional bugs.

The aim is to close the gap and increase design verification productivity. That means raising abstraction level of tests and simulation to reduce both development time and time to simulate.

### SystemVerilog
#### Procedures
In addition to Verilog's `always`-procedure SystemVerilog enables use of three more;

|Procedure	  	  |Logic			       |Sensitivity list|
|---------------|---------------|----------------
|`always_ff`	   |Sequential		   |Explicit
|`always_comb`	 |Combinational	 |Inferred from code
|`always_latch`	|Latched		      |Inferred from code

#### Connecting ports
Ports are connected using `DUT(.*)`, which means connect all ports to variables or nets with the same name as the ports.

#### Data types
|Type		     |Description
|-----------|-----------
|`reg`		    |4-state (Verilog-2001)
|`logic`	   |4-valued logic
|`bit`		    |2-state bit 0 or 1
|`integer`	 |4-state, 32-bit, signed (Verilog-2001)
|`byte`		   |8-bit signed integer
|`int`		    |2-state 32-bit signed integer
|`shortint`	|2-state 16-bit signed integer
|`longint`	 |2-state 64-bit signed integer

#### Testbench constructs

 - Queue
 - Mailbox
 - Fork/join
 - Class
 - Constraint
 - Covergroup
 - Program
 - Virtual interface
 - Clocking block
 - Modports
